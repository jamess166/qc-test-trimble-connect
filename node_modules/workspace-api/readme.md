# Trimble Connect 3D Viewer - Workspace API

The Workspace API of Trimble Connect 3D Viewer allows the client applications to interact with the 3D Viewer. It utilizes [window.postMessage()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) to facilitate the communication. There are two methods to utilize the Workspace API:
- The client application embeds the 3D Viewer in an [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
- The client application is embedded inside the 3D Viewer as a side panel.
